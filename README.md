# Controls
Controls is a library built on top of jQuery that makes dealing with control elements relatively painless. Specifically, it helps with client-side validation and state-setting. It is based on an earlier, similar library I wrote which is now called [controls-vanilla](https://github.com/nickb1080/controls-vanilla).

I've borrowed design patterns for both the library and the test suite from GitHub's very cool [space-pen](https://github.com/atom/space-pen) project.

# API
##`$.fn.controls()`



## `Controls`
This is the "class" returned by `$.fn.controls`, which extends jQuery. Thus, all `Controls` instances have all the jQuery methods, plus a few goodies described here.

## `Values`

## `data-control-validation`
